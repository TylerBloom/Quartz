## About
Quartz is a scientific computing stack for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The primary goal of Quartz is to provided support for a wide variety of data structures and algorithms like the Python library [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) while also providing tools (such as unit support) found in the C++ library [Boost](https://www.boost.org/).

## Disclaimer
Quartz is still **very** much under construction. If you would like to help grow the scientific computing community in Rust, submit an issue or pull request for a feature you would like to see supported.
